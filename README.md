# RobotC-MazeSolver

-	Implemented a program in which a virtual robot inside a 4 by 6 maze grid can automatically sense walls, save, and map an unknown maze into memory.
-	Navigate from the starting coordinates to end cell coordinates, while graphically updating the LCD remote screen with wall states, current robot position, and robot   orientation.
